# Homebrew install on macOS Sonoma (M3 Pro silicon)

Trying to install Homebrew on my new Mackbook Pro,

The OS is Sonoma 14.1.1, M3 Pro slicon


## Install with the script, failed.

According the guide Homebrew offical site: https://brew.sh/

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The logs shows now error, but when trying check with
```
brew --version
```
Shows error `brew not found`

Someone says it is caused by the Apple slicon version is installation directory `/opt/homebrew/bin`,

I checked, the directory of is empty?

## Install Homebrew by pkg file

Step by step, then try
```
brew --version
```

Works.
